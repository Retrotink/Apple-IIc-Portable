<br>
The primary compenents are right off of Amazon and modified to fit into a case. 

# Power Source
<br>
The battery power source is a $39.99 12000mAh battery pack that has been removed from its original case and modified so that a new
switch replaces the original. The charging circuit is modified so that when plugged in it is charging but no power comes out
until the new add-on switch is turned on. The original design would apply power all the time. 
<br>
This method gives us control of when we can turn on the entire computer and monitor with one switch. 
The Apple IIc power switch is left on covered by the new power connector that goes up into the battery circuit.
While this seems complex, the modification gives us the functionality to power the computer properly.
When plugged in, power is drawn from battery while also charging.

The hinge uses a stainless steel M4 rod that was cut to size and 2 nuts and washers were sourced from Home Depot.<br>

# The LCD Monitor
<br>

<br>
The LCD monitor is a $73 Hikity 10 inch LCD that runs on 12V and has VGA, BNC, composite and HDMI inputs. <br>
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077FSR36B/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=AZV2Q3JGU683F&psc=1<br>
It was programmed in 4:3 mode and the the LCD and driver board was removed from the original case.<br>
The button panel was disconnected from the driver board and set aside. It is not currently installed.<br>
The 3D PLA Plastic design carefully covers the monitor so that on power up, none of the boot graphics from the monitor appear.<br>
The VGA, BNC and HDMI connectors were removed by desoldering. The 12V connector was retained for easy conntion to the battery circuit.<br>
<br>

# Cables
<br>
A DB15 cable to composite runs up from that back of the Apple IIc, under the battery container and up into the LCD Panel.<br>
Power for the monitor does not come from the DB15 Video port but directly from the power supply board.<br>
The Power DIN connector runs up into the battery and connects to the battery circuit.<br>
A new switch in the power supply turns on both the computer and the monitor with one single throw of the switch<br>
<br>

# The 3D printed Case
<br>
For the 3D objects a Creality CR10S Pro V2 was used as the printer. It has a glass bed for good adhesion and objects are printed upright.<br>
The PLA FilaCube $23.97 and is pretty close in color to a retrobright Apple IIc.<br>
