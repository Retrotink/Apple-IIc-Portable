The primary compenents are right off of Amazon and modified to fit into a case. 

# Power Source
<br>
The battery power source is a 12000mAh battery pack that has been removed from its original case and modified so that a new
switch replaces the original. The charging circuit is modified so that when plugged in it is charging but no power comes out
until the new add-on switch is turned on. The original design would apply power all the time. 
<br>
This method gives us control of when we can turn on the entire computer and monitor with one switch. 
The Apple IIc power switch is left on covered by the new power connector that goes up into the battery circuit.
While this seems complex, the modification gives us the functionality to power the computer properly.
When plugged in, power is drawn from battery while also charging.
